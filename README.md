# Riesling Binder notebook demo
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/emilljungberg/riesling-binder/HEAD?filepath=Riesling_Demo.ipynb)

Jupyter notebook demonstrating the main functionality in the [`riesling`](https://github.com/spinicist/riesling) toolbox.

Note: The memory requirements for 3D reconstruction is beyond the limits in mybinder and you will therefore notice that this notebook will crash at some commands. I recommend downloading the repository and run this locally on your own machine.
